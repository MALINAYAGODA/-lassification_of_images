# Humpback Whale Identification

-----
### Description:
After centuries of intense whaling, recovering whale populations still
have a hard time adapting to warming oceans and struggle
to compete every day with the industrial fishing industry for food.

To aid whale conservation efforts, scientists use photo surveillance systems
to monitor ocean activity. They use the shape of whales’ tails and unique markings
found in footage to identify what species of whale they’re analyzing and meticulously
log whale pod dynamics and movements.
### Goal :
Develop an algorithm to identify individual whales in the images.
### Data:
The Happywhale database, consisting of more than 25,000 images collected by research
institutes and public organizations.
